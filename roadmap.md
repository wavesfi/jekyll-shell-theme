# Roadmap

- Stake Mining Period (DAO bootstrapping)
  * During this period, the Waves Finance DAO governance tokens will be distributed to all Waves.Fi lesssors instead of WAVES.
  * The amount of governance token each lessor receives is proportional to the amount of total WAVES staked.
  * Once 20k WAVES have been generated by the node, these WAVES will directly fund the 
   initial DAO code development.
  * Code review, DAO deployment and DAO website launch (for proposals and voting).
  * Once the Waves.FI node balance reaches 30k WAVES all WAVES will be transferred into the deployed DAO.
  * Governance token distribution has finnished with the transfer of funds.
  
- Age of the DAO
  * The DAO and its funds are completely governed by DAO token holders.
  

### Proposal Ideas

- To be decided upon by the DAO
  * Development of Market Maker Bots for Waves.Exchange in order to increase liquidity 
   and earn rewards for the DAO.
   * Development of cross-chain yield aggregating smart contracts.
